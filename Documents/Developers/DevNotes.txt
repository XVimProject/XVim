# Problem when yank and put block text #
   When yank and put with block selection it makes inserting some spaces to pad a line.
For example, assume we have following text,
-----------------------
aaaaaaa

bbbbbbb
-----------------------
there is a blank line between two "a" and "b" lines and block selection from first "a" to first "b"
makes ["a", "", "b"] as a selection. When yank this and put at 3rd "a" will results in padding 3 spaces
in 2nd line to put ""(empty string). 
The problem is that when Xcode's preference "Automatically trim trailing whitespaces" will delete the 
spaces after putting the yanked text.
It looks that it does not big problem but when you want to "undo" the put operation you have to type 
"u" twice because the actions taken when we put are "Insert ["a", "", "b"] into each line" and "trim 
trailing whitespace" and first "u" command only undo the "trim..." action.
I tried to group them up into one action to undo with one "u" commnad but could not.


### How to control documents (Open, Close) ###
You can use IDEDocumentController. Its like...
   IDEDocumentController* ctrl = [IDEDocumentController sharedDocumentController];
   NSError* error;
   NSURL* doc = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:@"/foo/bar/test.h"];
   [ctrl openDocumentWithContentsOfURL:doc display:YES error:&error];


### Debugger area / Console Area ###
To access console area (debugger area) you can use 
    IDEDefaultDebugArea* debuggerArea = [(IDEDefaultDebugArea*)[XVimLastActiveEditorArea() activeDebuggerArea];
IDEDefaultDebuggerArea is a NSViewContoroller and has "varibles view" and  "console view" as you can see in bottom of Xcode window.

To access "condole view" you can use
    IDEConsoleArea *console = [debuggerArea consoleArea];
This is also NSViewController.
If you want to access its view you have to get the view but it does provides public property to access it.
So we have to specify the instance varible name to get the view as below.
    IDEConsoleTextView* pView;
    object_getInstanceVariable(console , "_consoleView" , (void**)&pView);
Now "pView" is IDEConsoleTextView (subclass of NSView)

To insert text into the console view you can do like
    pView.logMode = 1;
    [pView insertText:@"some text"]
I do not know what is logMode but you have to specify it to insert text (otherwise you can not insert text).

IDEConsoleArea has filterMode property. This property indicates the filter you can specify in console area.
You can see "All Output","Deubbger Output","Target Output" pulldown selection button on top of the console area.
The values corresponds like
  0 - All Output
  1 - Debugger Output
  2 - Target Output



### DVTSourceTextview / DVTFoldingTextStorage / DVTTextStorage
DVTSourceText view is a subclass of NSTextView.
NSTextView has NSTextStorage to hold its content and DVTFoldingTextStorage is the claas corresponds it in Xcode.

DVTFoldingTextStorage is handling string in a DVTSourceTextView with folding state.
For example, we often have a placeholder in the text view (the highlighted words when you type some method)
Internally it is just a text like "< # placholder #>" and it is showl as just "placeholder" with blue highlighted.
(I put space between < and # above because Xcode automatically holds it if it is not there)
In this case ,DVTFoldingTextStorage will give a string "placeholder" to its text view.
And DVTFoldingTextStorage has a property "realTextStorage"(DVTTextStorage) which holds internal text notation including < # part.
So the length of the text is different between internal text notation and text acutually shown in the view.
We have to handle these correctly when we calc the position in a text. We usually can use just a
DVTFoldingTextStorage's methods but sometimes we need to know acutal length in internal text.



### Exception occurs when you edit DVTFoldingTextStorage when the view is showing complition list
When I tried to implement "hlsearch" I had to update text view (text storage) whenever they type (insert/delete) text because they puroduce
some text which match/unmatch the currently search string.
Highlighting a text is done via editing text storage object in a text view (DVTFoldingTextStorage in this case).
So I update the storage whenever they type something. But it causes exceptions in DVTFoldinTextStorage.
If I tried to edit the storage while the view is showing autocompletion it causes exception and break the completion feature.
Currently I use NSTextViewDidChangeNotification to know when to update highlight state.


### Preferences
Colors or some features on Xcode is configured via "Preferences" menu.
Preferences are mainly managed by NSUserDefaults.
But if you change NSUserDefaults directly it is not applied to Xcode views.
(I think the views are listening "Preference" controller and not the NSUserDefaults itself)

What I found so far is that for text preferences you can use DVTTextPreferences class. (It took 5 hours to find this...)
It has a class method which returns global singleton DVTTextPreferences object. When you set its property
it is properly affected to views.
It is like...

      [DVTTextPreferences preferences].showLineNumbers = YES;
      
      
### Thick insertion point(caret) drawing in NSTextView
In NSTextView you can find a method "drawInsertionPointInRect:color:turnedOn:" which obviously draws insertion point.
So it looks that overriding (or hooking) the method and just changing the "rect" is enough to achieve our goal.
Unforunately it does not work correctly.

I here explain how the insertion point on a NSTextView is drawn.

The method is fired by timer which is set by NSTextView internally. On each time it toggles "turnedOn:" argument
so if the flag is ON you must draw insertion point and clear the insertion point when the flag is OFF.
This makes a caret blinking.

It is easy to draw insertion point but clearing insertion point is not so simple.
Assume that you have a caret at the left side of a character and the caret and the caracter is overlapping.
(Usual caret is only 1 or 2 pixel so it is not big problem but we will draw thick caret as Vim does)
When clearing a caret you have to redraw the character under the caret. To do so what you have to do is 
   - Clear the area (rect) of the caret with background color
   - Draw the (part of)character which resides in the rect

Redrawing a specific area is a job done by drawRect: method (See Cocoa document). So acutual thing you should do in the
drawInsertionInRect:... method is
   - Draw caret if the flag is ON
   - Call setNeedsDisplayInRect for the caret area if the flag is OFF. (This will lead drawRect being called)

This is perhaps what default implementation of the NSTextView is doing

so the pseudo code for the method is as following.

 - (void)drawInsertionPointInRect:(NSRect)rect color:(NSColor*)color turnedOn:(BOOL)flag{
    if( flag ){
        // Draw caret
        // NSTextView has a internal method to draw a caret
        [self _drawInsertionPointInRect:rect color:color];
    }else{
        // Clear caret
        // To clear firs they clear the rect which is previously drawn by _drawInsertionPointInRect:color: above
        // It is saved in internal varibale "_insertionPointRect"
        // So first clear the region of _insertionPointRect and then call following
        [self setNeedsDisplayInRect:_insertionPointRect];
    }
 }

 ( This code is from my analysis of the behaviour. No guarantee. )
 
 What this means is that NSTextView uses _drawInsertionPointInRect to draw the caret when the flag is ON.
 If the flag is OFF it calls setDisplayInRect: to redraw the previously drawn caret.
 The important thing is that NSTextView keeps its insertion point rect as internal variable named "_insertionPointRect"

 And one more thing we have to know about drawing insertion point.
 _drawInsertionPointInRect:color: method is also called from setSelectedRange method.
 When you move a cursor, It immideately change the position of the caret. To achive this,
 _drawInsertionPointInRect:color: is called.
 
 So everything in mind insertion point drawing methods should be like folloiwng.

 - (void)_drawInsertionPointInRect:(NSRange*)rect color:(NSColor*)color{
     // Some code...

     [color setFill];
     NSFillRect(rect);
    // Keep rect to clear this region later (when drawInsertionPointInRect is called with the flag OFF)
     _insertionPointRect = rect;

     // Some code...
 }

 - (void)drawInsertionPointInRect:(NSRect)rect color:(NSColor*)color turnedOn:(BOOL)flag{
    if( flag ){
        // Draw caret
        [self _drawInsertionPointInRect:rect color:color];
    }else{
        // Clear caret
        // To clear firs they clear the rect which is previously drawn by _drawInsertionPointInRect:color: above
        // It is saved in internal varibale "_insertionPointRect"
        // So first clear the region of _insertionPointRect and then call following
        [self setNeedsDisplayInRect:_insertionPointRect];
    }
 }
 
 - (void)setSelectedRange:(NSRange)range{
    // Some code...
    
    // Clear current caret useing _insertionPointRect

    // Calculate new caret rect from the range argument
    // And then
    [self _drawInsertionPointInRect:rect color:_insertionPointColor];

    // acutal setSelectedRagen is just a stub for setSelectedRange:affinity:stillSelecting:
 }
 
 - (void)insertionTimerExpired{
    // Calculate the caret rect from current selected range
    // And then
    _insertionPointOn = !_insertionPointOn; // Inverse the internal flag for insertoin point drawing.
    [self drawInsertionPointInRect:rect color:_insertionPointColor turnedOn:_insertionPointOn];
 }


 Now let us think how to make thick insertion point. Following actually works as we expect.
  - Hook drawInseritonPointInRect:colro:flag
  - Resize the rect argument to fit into the caracter at insertion point. (make it thick)
  - Call original darwInsertionPointInRect...

 But we have a problems.
 _drawInsertionPointRect uses NSRectFill to draw insertion point which completely override the color of the text with the caret color.
 There is no transparency.

 The next thing we can think of is hooking _drawInsertionPointInRect:... method. 
 And draw insertion point without calling original _drawInsertionPointInRect:..
 It should be like this.

 - (void)_drawInsertionPointRect:(NSRect)rect color:(NSColor*)color{
    // Change rect to be fit to the character at the inseriton point. 
    // And then
    
    [color set];
	NSRectFillUsingOperation( rect, NSCompositeSourceOver);

    // And do not call original _drawInsertionPointRect:...
 }

 This solves the problem. But we have another problem then.
 NSTextView keeps insertion point rect to clear the caret. If we do not call the original one NSTextView never has a chance 
 to keep the rect which results in that NSTextView never clears the caret. It means caret never blinks or
 drawn carets are stays on all the caracters it pass.

 So what we have to do is update _insertionPointRect varibles in NSTextView when we override _drawInsertionPointRect:... method.
 
 This is what XVim is currently doing. (See acutual implementation in XVimSourceTextViewHook.m)




### Hilight Search ###
To achieve hilight search XVim hooks 2 methods in DVTSourceTextView
   - didChangeText
   - drawRect

In didChangeText XVim mark that we have to update found location by searching a text(last searched string).
(We never do searching at this timing)

In drawRect XVim update found locations if didChangeText marked that we need to update found locations.
And then according to the locations drawRect sets text attribute for the ranges of found locations. And then draw the rect.

The reason why we never do searching in didChangeText but just mark that update is needed is that
we can not update found locatiosn when a text view is initialized.
We have to update found locations for a new content when new DVTSourceView and its content is updated.
When Xcode changes text content to newly selected file (wehen you click a file in navigation pane) Xcode create new DVTSourceTextView and its text storage objects.
We can know hen DVTSourceTextView is created by hooking initWithCoder method.
But unfortunately I have not found any good method to hook to know when a "text" in DVTSourceTextView is initialized.
A text in DVTSourceTextView is kept in DVTTextStorage and its subclasses but I could not find good property to observe.
(No property change notifies us that the content is initialized.)
This is one of reason why XVim tries update found locations if needed all the time it draws rect.

To support to change highlighted locations when we put ":set hlsearch" or search new text, XVim sets up observing properties in XVimOption and XVimSearch object.

See DVTSourceTextViewHook.m for the detail


### Handling DVTFoldingTextStorage (This is only for Xcode4) ###
DVTSourceTextView has a DVTFoldingTextStorage as its text storage.
The big difference between DVTFoldingTextStorage and NSTextStorage is supporting folding.
In DVTFoldingTextStorage you can not simply calculate the character index. For example, text following

abcd < #placeholder# >

has a folding. DVTFoldingTextStorage represents place holder with '< #' and '# >'.  (I intentionally add space between < and # not to be handled as a placeholder here. In actual text there is no space.)
The text above results in

abcd placeholder

where "placeholder" part is place holder(blue background color) and counted as one character.
DVTFoldingTextStorage manages the relation between these 2 text and gives us an interface to access both.

To access "raw" string representation you just call [storage string] method. This never considers a folding and returns "raw" string.
If you want to know the length of raw string just call [storage string].length .

To access "folded" string, before you call [storage string] you have to call [storage increaseUsingFoldedRanges] method.
This method tells DVTFoldingTextStorage that we want to access "folded" representation of the storage. After calling this method
all the method calls to the storage will be handled to the "folded" string. You have to call [storage decreaseUsingFoldedRanges] after 
finished to access to the folded representation because someone else who are using it later considers that default state of the storage is
"raw" string accessing mode.
So usually what you have to write is

[storage increaseUsingFoldedRanges];
[storage string]; // or what ever you want to do on the folded string representation
[storage decreaseUsingFoldedRanges];

The example above has a text "abcd " and one placeholder.
In this case the length of the string of folded representation is 6 (5 + 1 for placeholder).
The character at placeholder returns 0xFFFC. This means the code below

[storage increaseUsingFoldedRanges];
unichar c = [[storage string] characterAtIndex:5];
[storage decreaseUsingFoldedRanges];

make 'c' to have 0xFFFC.

0xFFFC is a NSAttachmentCharacter (See NSTextAttachment class reference).
This means that this character is handled as an attachment by layout manager (DVTLayoutManager) and will be drawn as 
a special glyph.

In XVim, we usually do not want to handle "raw" representation of the folded storage but "folded" representation.
So if we want to make some changes or calculate positions in a DVTFoldingTextStorage we usually need to call increaseUsingFoldedRanges.



### View Controllers and View relations ###

Xcode has a lot of view controllers and associated views.
Here is the hierarchy. Each entity is a class name or a property/method name Xcode uses.
This is because sometimes it is not understandable the meaning of a entity only from its class name.
Arrow represent has-a or has-many relation ship.

   Controllers                                   Window/Views

(*1) IDEEditorModeViewController is a super class of following 3 classes
      - IDEEditorBasicMode
      - IDEEditorGeniusMode
      - IDEEditorVersionMode
     These 3 mode corresponds the icons on top right side of Xcode window labeled "Editor"
     Genius mode has 2 editor context (primary and secondary)


(*2) IDEEditor is a common super class of all kinds of editors in Xcode.
     IDEEditor includes IDESourceCodeEditor, IDEComparisonEditor.
     These editors are provided plugins (See Xcode.app/Contents/Plugins directory).
     

(*3) lastActiveEditorContext is a IDEEditorContext object which has had focus most recently.

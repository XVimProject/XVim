<h1>XVim - Xcode plugin for Vim keybindings</h1>
XVim is a plugin for Xcode4 which enables you to edit codes as if you are using Vim in Xcode.

<h2>Goal</h2>
The goal of this project is to provide confortable environment for Vim users to use Xcode4 to develop their software.
This means the goal is NOT to provide full compatiblity to Vim operations.
Some keybinds could behave differently than Vim's original one since there are lot of difference between Vim environment and IDE environment of Xcode with rich of features.

<h2>Goal in short term</h2>
This project has started in Jan 2012. In short term goal is to implement major operations like navigation with "h,j,k,l", search with "/,?" or replace with ":s".
See project page which are implemented and not implemented.

<h2>Internal Design</h2>
It may be difficult to implement new features or fix bugs without understanding the overview of the plugin design.
Here is the overview of the design.

<h3>Big picture</h3>
This plugin consits of mainly 2 parts. "Hooks" and "Operations".
Hooks part hook some methods of Xcode classes. The most important hook is hooking "keyDown:" in DVTSourceTextView class. This hook catches keydown event in source editor and fowards its event to the "Operations" part .(DVTSourceTextView is the area(view) where you write code in Xcode source editor.)
Operations part handles inputs from keyboard (or mouse) and reflects its result to DVTSourceTextView or other views.

For the detail of these two parts see comments in corresponds codes. 

<h3>Loading</h3>
Unfortunately Xcode plugin system is not documented and we do not know well about loading sequences of plugins.
The only thing we( could be "I" ) know is that the bundle in the following directory is loaded into Xcode automatically.

<pre><code>
$(HOME)/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins/
</code></pre>

When the plugin is loaded, the class method "load" in principle class( XVim class in this case ) is called.
This ( "load" method in XVim.m" ) is the entry point of the plugin and we setup hooks here.

<h3>Hooks</h3>
So in "load" method we hooks some methods. Here is all the hooks we should know.
The hooking is kind of replacing methods with other methods.
For example, keyDown: method in DVTSourceTextView is replaced with keyDown: method in DVTSourceTextViewHook class (which is our class).
What happend to the original method is that it is renamed. In this case it is renamed to XVimKeyDown method.
So the following picture describes the methods after hook is done to keyDown: method in DVTSourceTextView class.

<h4>initWithCoder</h4>
This is called when a DVTSourceTextView object is initialized. What we want to do in this hook is to bind "Operations" part to this object.
As explained, we hook keyDown: and forward it to "Operations" part (which is a object we make). In the hook method of keyDown: we want to know where is the "operation" object corresponds to the DVTSourceTextView.


<h4>keyDown: and Evaluators</h4>
Will be writen later

<h2>Xcode internal classes</h2>
You can find internal classes or methods <a href="https://github.com/probablycorey/xcode-class-dump/tree/master/docs">here</a>
This is help to understand its internal and functions.
Especially the class DVTSourceTextView has a lot of methods and can be reusable to implement Vi operations.

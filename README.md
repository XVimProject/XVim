  Create `.xvimrc` as you need and restart your Xcode. 

### Manual build and install
 - Download source code(See also "Branches and Releases" section) and open XVim.xcodeproj with Xcode.

    - "XVim for Xcode5 and 6" must be built with Xcode5 or 6
 - Select "Edit Scheme" and set "Build Configuration" as "Release"
 - Build it. It automatically installs the plugin into the correct directory.
 - Restart Xcode. (Make sure that the Xcode process is terminated entirely)

## Branches and Releases
 XVim has several branches and releases. Usually you only need to download one of 'releases' and use it.
 Here is an explanation about each release and branch.
 
 - Releases(tags) : Releases are tags on master branch. All the code and documents on these tags are well arranged. Usual XVim user should use one of releases.
 - master : Most stable branch. Critical bug fixes and stable feature developed in 'develop' branch are merged into 'master'. If you find a critical bug in a release, try latest 'master' branch.
 - develop : New features and non critical bug fixes are merged into this branch. If you want experimental features use this branch.

 Any other branches are temporary branches to develop features or bug fixes which will be merged into 'develop' branch after all.
 Any pull requests should be made to 'develop' branch.

## Uninstall

  $ make uninstall

### Manual uninstall

## Feature list

## Bug reports
  Unfortunately XVim sometimes crashes Xcode. We are working on eliminating all the bugs, but it's really hard work.
  It helps greatly when we have your bug reports, with the following information:

   * Crash information ( Xcode shows threads stack trace when crashes. Copy them. )
   * The operations you did to cause the crash ( series of key strokes or mouse clicks )
   * The text you were manipulating
   * Xcode version 
   * XVim version ( Version number of the revision you built )
  
  When it is hard to solve a problem with information above, take debug log according to the following movie please.

  We appreciate if you write test case for the bug. Read "Write test" section in Documents/Developsers/PullRequest.md how to write test case. You do not need to update any source code but just write 7 items explained there in an issue you create.

/**
 * Repeat(.) command related methods.
 *
 * How to use:
 * Call appendOperationKeyStroke to append operation commands.
 * Until you call fixOperationCommand it is saved int temporary buffer.
 * When the command is fixed call fixOperationCommand method.
 * This saves the commands to lastOperationCommands property.
 * If you want to cancel the command call cancelOperationCommands.
 *
 * This is because not all the key input should be recorded into
 * repeat command register but only edit commands should be stored.
 *
 * Whenever key input occurs key hanlder(XVimWindow) calls
 * appendOperationKeyStroke method with the input.
 * When the command is fixed with edit command related evaluators
 * it calls fixOperationCommand.
 * If it is not called and when a command(series of key input) is 
 * finished XVimWindow calls cancelRepeatCommand not to store the
 * key input recorded in repeat regisger so far.
 *
 * When repeating you must call startRepeat first and 
 * call endRepeat after you finish repeating.
 * When in repeating the key input never recorded into 
 * repeat regisgter

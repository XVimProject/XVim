/**
 * This is a class for managing marks
 * In Vim they have 3 kinds of marks.
 *    - 'a-z' lowercase marks(local marks) which is valid within a file (each file has each lower case mark set)
 *    - 'A-Z' upper case marks(file marks) which is valid between file (One set of A-Z mars is shared by all files)
 *    - '0-9' numbered marks. This is special marks and XVim does not support it.
 *
 * And there is some special marks like ',`,.,^ ... (These are also managed witin local marks in this class)
 *
 * For local marks XVim create XVimMarks object for each document.
 * Marks are managed in NSDictionary like { @"a" => markObj, @"b" => markObj2, ... }
 * As a result this class has
 *    - one dictionary for file mark set (XVim global and shared by all the text views). Its like { @"A" => markObj, @"B"=> markObj2... }
 *    - multiple dictionaries for local mark set like
 *        { @"a" => markObj1, @"b" => markObj2, ... } for document1
 *        { @"a" => markObjX, @"b" => markObjY, ... } for document2
 *        ...
 * All the mark dictionaries have full set of marks. If a mark is not set its lineNumber properties is set to NSNotFound.
 *
 * Implementation Note:
 * You never replace mark object in a dictionary once you initialize the dictionary.
 * If you want to set change mark in a dictionary you must copy the data into the mark already in the dictionary.
 * This is because some marks shares one mark object in a dictionary (e.g. ` and ' marks)

/**
 * TODO:
 * We are not changing mark position when inserting newlines before the mark position.
 * Vim manages its text by keeping each lines and when it insert new line the mark position also moves accordingly

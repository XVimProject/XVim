/** @brief Protocol that must be implemented by the NSTextStorage you intend to hook
 *
 * Note that the terms here do not have the usual Cocoah meaning
 *
 * "Character"
 *   Character is a one unichar value. (any value including tabs,spaces)
 *
 * "index"
 *   This is the 0-based location of a given character within -xvim_string.
 *
 * "Position"
 *   This is an XVimPosition (line + column)
 *
 * "EOF"
 *   EOF is the position of the end of the document (-length),
 *   so for a text of "abc", EOF is just after the 'c', at position 3.
 *
 *   What we have to think about is that a cursor can be at EOF,
 *   but -[xvim_string characterAtIndex:] at this position raises.
 *
 *   We have to be careful about it when computing motions effects.
 *
 * "Newline"
 *   Newline is defined as "unichar determined by isNewline function".
 *   Usually "\n" or "\r".
 *
 * "Line"
 *   Line is a sequence of characters terminated by newline or EOF.
 *   "Line" includes the last newline character.
 *   Line numbers start at 1
 *
 * "Blankline"
 *   Blankline is a line which has only newline or EOF.
 *   In other words, it is newline character or EOF after newline character.
 *
 * "Last of Line(LOL)"
 *   Last of line is the last character of a line EXCLUDING newline character.
 *   This means that blankline does NOT have an Last of line.
 *
 * "First of Line(FOL)"
 *   First of line is the first character of a line excluding newline character.
 *   This means that blankline does NOT have a First of line.
 *
 * "First Nonblank of Line"
 *   First Nonblank of Line is the first printable character in a line.
 *
 * "End of Line(EOL)"
 *   End of Line is newline or EOF character at the end of a line.
 *   A line always has an EOL.
 *
 * "Beginning of Line (BOL)"
 *   First character of a line including newline and EOF
 *
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * Implementation notes for developpers
 *
 * XVim provides a default implementation of this protocol
 * on an NSTextStorage Category.
 *
 * The functions that are reused to implement other of the protocol are marked
 * as "XVIM PRIMITIVE" which means that if you want to adapt for a given
 * NSTextStorage subclass, those are the only one you probably need to
 * consider for reimplementing.

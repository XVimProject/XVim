// Evaluator classes Hierarchy
/*
XVimEvaluators and its subclasses are the class to handle keyboad input.
Upper class of these evaluator hierarchy implement common process of keyboard input.
For example "motions" such as 'w','b' are handled by XVimMotionEvaluator and this is common parent class for a class
which needs to take a motions as operations. XVimDeleteEvaluator is one of the subclass of XVimMotionEvaluator ( its direct parent is XVimOperatorEvaluator ).
 
XVimEvaluator - Evaluator base
|- XVimNumericEvaluator - Handles numeric input
     |- XVimMotionEvaluator- Handles motions
          |- XVimNormalEvaluator - Handle normal mode. If XVimTextObject handled motion, this evaluator just move the cursor to the end point of the motion.
 
And Most of the command which takes "Motion" as argument they are derived from XVimMotionEvaluator.

XVimMotionEvaluator
|- XVimOperatorEvaluator
|    |- XVimVisualEvaluator - Handles Visual mode (Move cursor as per motion and expand the selection)
|    |- XVimDeleteEvaluator - Handles 'd' and 'c' command.
|    .... and so on. 
|
|- XVimNormalEvaluator
|- XVimVisualEvaluator
... And so on.

/**
 * About eval: method.
 * This method handles key input.
 * You usually do not need to override this method.
 * Default implementation tries to find a method named same as key input and calls it
 * and returns its return value directly.
 * For example if 'a' is an input it tries to call a: method and the method must return XVimEvaluator* .
 * The meaning of evaluator returned from each method is explained below.
 * So what derived classes of XVimEvaluators should do is adding methods to handle key input.
 * If it does not find any matched method to call it returns Invalud Evaluator explained below.
 *
 * The return value is one of followings
 *  - Next Evaluator
 *  - self
 *  - nil
 *  - Invalid Evaluator
 *
 * If this method returns any valid evaluator other than self it will be handled as a next
 * evaluator and the next key input will be redirected to the returned evaluator.
 * If this method returns self it means next evaluator is itself and next key input is still
 * passed to this evaluator.
 * If it returns nil it means this evaluator finished its task and the parent evaluator
 * (which is the evaluator previously created this evaluator and returned it as a next evaluator)
 * will be notified that its child evaluator finished its task via onChildComplete: method.
 * If it returns invalid evaluator (which is [XVimEvaluator invalidEvaluator]) it means
 * the key input to this evaluator is invalid and cancel all the input observed so far (which is almost
 * same as inputing "ESC" )

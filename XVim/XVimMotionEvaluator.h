 * The difference between motionFixed and _motionFixed:
 * _motionFixed is called internaly from its inherited classes.
 * After _motionFixed method does some common conversion to the motion or commmon operation
 * it calls motionFixed method with the converted motion.
 * So mainly you have to implement motionFixed method to delete/yanking or other operation with a motion.
 * If you want to implement new motion for a input you implement a selector for the input
 * and should call _motionFixed with the newly created motion.

@implementation IDEEditorAreaHook
/**
 * IDEEditorArea is a area including primary editor and assistant editor and debug area (The view right of the navigator)
 * This class hooks IDEEditorArea and does some works.
 * "viewDidInstall" is called when the view setup is done ( as far as I saw the behaviour ).
 * This class has private instance variable named "_editorAreaAutoLayoutView" which is the view
 * contains source code editores and border view between editors and debug area.
 * We insert command line view between editors and debug area.
 * And also to handle all the input to editors we insert XVimWindow object into this view as invisible view.
 * All the input to the editors (DVTSourceTextView) or command line view is forward to XVimWindow class.
 *
 * IDEEdiatorArea exists in every Xcode tabs so if you have 4 tabs in a Xcode window there are 4 command line and XVimWindow views we insert.

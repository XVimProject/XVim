Hire me!
========

I do not know if this is good place to look for a job but I'd like to try.
I'm currently looking for a next job, hopefully in the US.

I have been working as a programmer/project manager for 10 years including part time job when I was a university student.

What I can do is
 - program with C/C++
 - program with Objective-C (as you already know)
 - Create Windows applications (including services, multi threading, networking)
 - Windows kernel programming ( I have exprience with writing filesystem filter driver)
 - Reverse engineering by reading assembly languages 
 - Code review with security insight

Job I'm looking for is
 - programming with Windows or Mac or iOS
 - located in Japan or US ( If working remotely is permitted I don't care the company location )
 - well managed environment ( well defined development process, code reviewing, testing )
   (You must have QA team)
 - the application to develop is NOT social game.

Any other factors are negotiatable.

Here's my LinkedIn profile.
